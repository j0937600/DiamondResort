# Diamond Resort Website

## Overview

The Diamond Resort website is a comprehensive platform developed primarily using the Java Servlet MVC model with an Oracle database for the backend and JSP for the frontend. To explore other languages and frameworks, I am currently refactoring the code. For the backend, I integrated Java Servlet with Hibernate ORM and Spring MVC, and for the frontend, I integrated JSP with React.js.

## Progress of Refactoring

### Backend
- **Hibernate:** `src/com/roomrsv/model/RoomRsvDAO.java`
- **SpringMVC:** `src/com/shoppingCart/model/CartDAO.java`

### Frontend
- **React.js:** `WebContent/frontend/meal`

## Customer Features
- Room Reservations
- Room Service Order (Food, Amenities, etc.)
- Shopping Center

## Staff Functionality
- Check-In/Check-Out Management
- Room Management
- Shopping Center Management
- Guest Service Management
