# Diamond Resort Website
Overview
The Diamond Resort website is a comprehensive platform developed primarily using the Java Servlet MVC model with an Oracle database for the backend and JSP for the frontend. To explore other languages and frameworks, I am doing code refactor now. For backend, I integrated Java Servlet with Hibernate ORM and Spring MVC, and for frontend, I integrate JSP with React.js.

Progress of refactoring
-Backend
--Hibernate: src/com/roomrsv/model/RoomRsvDAO.java
--SpringMVC: src/com/shoppingCart/model/CartDAO.java

-Frontend
--React.js: WebContent/frontend/meal

Customer Features
-Room Reservations
-Room Service Order (Food, Amenity...)
-Shopping Center 

Staff Functionality

-Room Management
-Shopping Center Management
