                when you visit a website or use an app. We use cookies on our websites and apps to personalize content

                cookies) through your browser. Check your browser's Help menu or your built-in mobile device settings to
                find out how. Some mobile devices store cookies not only in areas connected to the browser, but also in
                areas that are app-specific, which cannot be controlled by the browser settings. Check your app settings
                options on your mobile device to find out how to manage or delete cookies that may be stored in these

                advertisements to you, unique third-party persistent cookies, clear gifs or beacon gifs may be placed on
                your computer or device to help manage our online advertising, recognize when a device visits our
                websites, learn which ads bring users to our websites, and track whether a reservation is made. The
                information our ad-serving providers and we collect through this technology is not personally
                identifiable but is used to create an anonymous profile which allows the ad-serving provider to serve
